# COVID-19-Live-Data
This program Gets the information regarding the data of coronavirus from www.worldometers website and saves them into a CSV file. The next thing this program provides us with is the maps of each type of the data, like total cases, total death and etc. This program also creates a diagram and saves it. All of these data will be saved into "data & map" directory and you can refer to them any time you want. The thing that should be notice is that 'every time you run the program, all data, including pie chart image, maps and CSV data will be refreshed according to the live data on the website'. If you are running the program for the first and there is no file in the data & map directory, all these data will be created after you run the program. Make sure to run the maps on a "Browser" like Firefox, Chrome, Safari or etc.
